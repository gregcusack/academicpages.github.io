Originally from Santa Barbara, CA, I am a first year Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering at the [University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/).  I work in the [Network and Security Research (NSR) Lab](http://nsr.colorado.edu/) advised by [Dr. Eric Keller](https://eric-keller.github.io).  I received Bachelor's degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Engineering at [Santa Clara University](https://www.scu.edu/) advised by [Dr. Aleksandar Zecevic](http://www.engr.scu.edu/~azecevic/) and [Dr. Darren Atkinson](http://www.cse.scu.edu/~atkinson/), respectively.  I spent a year in the [Circuits & Embedded Systems](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/circuits-embedded-systems/) Masters Program at the [University of California, Los Angeles](http://www.ucla.edu/) in the 2016-2017 school year before transfering to the University of Colorado.  My research is focused in the area of computer network systems and security.  Current projects include detecting ransomware via its network traffic signature.

When I'm not in the lab, you can find me swimming, biking, or running.  I race for [CU Triathlon](https://www.cutriathlon.com/) and love all things bikes.  As an undergrad, I played four years of rugby for Santa Clara University as a member of the [SCUTS](http://www.santaclararfc.com/).
